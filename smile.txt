Why is your smile beautiful????

Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. 
To someone who has seen a dozen people frown,
scowl or turn their faces away, 
your smile is like the sun 
breaking through the clouds.
Keep smiling, 
because life is a beautiful thing and 
there's so much to smile about. 
Your smile is the ultimate golden dream.
Your smile is the best......

Your beautifully carved lips,
and not so perfect white teeth
The smirk on your face,
when you are thinking of something mischiveous
and that shy golden smile,
when you cannot express yourself
Everything, 
Everything that is yours, fascinates me.

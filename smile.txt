Your smile

It is believed it takes about 42 muscles to smile. 
Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles 
at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a 
"Duchenne smile". ... Among humans, smiling is 
an expression denoting pleasure, sociability, 
happiness, joy or amusement.

Smile is a general term, but I can find specifications in that generalization.
Your smile, it is your smile that I love.

Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. 
To someone who has seen a dozen people frown,
 scowl or turn their faces away, 
your smile is like the sun 
breaking through the clouds.
 Keep smiling, because life
 is a beautiful thing and 
there's so much to smile about. 
Your smile is the ultimate golden dream.
Your smile is the best......

Why is your smile beautiful????

Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. 
To someone who has seen a dozen people frown,
 scowl or turn their faces away, 
your smile is like the sun 
breaking through the clouds.
 Keep smiling, because life
 is a beautiful thing and 
there's so much to smile about. 
Your smile is the ultimate golden dream.
Your smile is the best......
